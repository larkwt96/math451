Algorithm 1:
Normally, you'd need to get a constant and subdeterminant for every row, but in this case, there are only two rows and two subcases.
The first subcase is the main diagonal. A constant times the determinant of the
smaller matrix, a recursive case:
Complexity of case 1 is the complexity of the n-1 case.

The second subcase is the A_21 times the determinant of the first row and sub columns.
