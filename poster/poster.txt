Introduction and motivation

-~*~- Numerical Analysis -~*~-
* I will use difference in time steps to show Runge-Kutta 4 converges
* I will comment on calculation analysis
* I will comment on the fact that we can't get the exact error but only prove existence
* I will use high Runge-Kutta 4 as the baseline and analyze Runge cutter 2 err

-~*~- Application -~*~-
I will vary emigration/immigration rate
I will start with different start conditions.
I will vary carrying capacity
    Changes the overall hight of the graph.
